General
=======
* put class declarations in header files.
* header file suffix is '.hxx', implementation file suffix is ".cxx".
* prefix objects from other namespaces at every occurence with their
  proper name, if they are not used often or part of TV:
  
  GOOD:
  	std::cout
  BAD:
  	using namespace std;

* newly added files should be added to CVS as soon as possible
  and added to the makefiles as well.
* use Unix line breaks.


#include order:
===============

1. <allegro.h>
2. Legacy (if any) and system headers
3. C and C++ standard headers
4. Local headers

Alphabetical order within these categories.


Header files
============

* protect against multiple inclusion:
	#ifndef NAME_HXX
	#define NAME_HXX
	
	[ guts ]
	
	#endif
